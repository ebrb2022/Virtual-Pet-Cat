Virtual Pet Cat - Dashboard
---
Description:
---
An interactive, browser-based dashboard where users can engage with a virtual cat in real time. They have the ability to feed, play with, and put the cat to sleep via button clicks, plus view the cat's current mood and health status. Users earn money from a happy or content cat, for which the money can be used to hire a pet sitter for 1, 6, or 12 hours, which gradually restores the stats.
